      "recipe": "For a basic omelette, crack the eggs into a mixing bowl with two teaspoons of cream, add a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Beat well with a fork. Heat a small knob of butter in a small frying pan on a low heat, and once melted and bubbling, add the eggs and move the pan around to spread them out evenly.When the omelette begins to cook and firm up, but still has a little raw egg on top, sprinkle over the cheese (if using). I sometimes grate mine directly on to the omelette. Using a spatula, ease around the edges of the omelette, then fold it over in half. When it starts to turn golden brown underneath, remove the pan from the heat and slide the omelette on to a plate.",

Place the chicken carcasses, garlic, vegetables, parsley and peppercorns in a large, deep-bottomed pan. Add the cold water and bring to the boil, skim, then turn the heat down to a simmer. Continue to simmer gently for 3-4 hours, skimming as necessary, then pass the broth through a fine sieve. Allow to cool for about half an hour, then refrigerate. Once the broth is cold it should look clear and slightly amber in colour. You can divide it into small plastic containers at this point and freeze it. It will keep in the fridge for about 4 days and in the freezer for 2-3 months.",

Put 1 tablespoon of butter and pat that all over, too. Strip the rosemary leaves off one of the stalks and finely chop them, using the cross chop method – it keeps your fingers out of the way. Rub the chopped rosemary into the steak. Carefully place the steak into the hot pan and cook for 2 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or until cooked to your liking. Use the remaining rosemary sprig to brush the butter from the pan over the steak as it cooks, adding loads of lovely flavour.",

Heat a lug of butter in a saucepan over a medium heat, add the garlic and fry for 1 to 2 minutes, or until golden. Add the basil stalks and chopped tomatoes, breaking the tomatoes up with the back of a spoon. Bring to the boil, season with sea salt and black pepper and simmer for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat and season to taste, if needed. Finish off the sauce by stirring through the parsley leaves. Toss the spagetti in the sauce, adding a little cooking water to loosen, if needed. Enjoy!",
